Online Movie Ticket Service

The Online Movie Ticket Service (OMTS) is an online service that allows users to browse movies that are playing in a variety of locations. Users are able to reserve a ticket through the application as well as view and write reviews on any movie they chose. The web application also contains important functionality for admins that allows them to edit other accounts, update and add theatres, and movies, as well as connect the two with showings.
